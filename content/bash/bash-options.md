# Bash options

💡 Options are settings that change shell or script behaviour. The `set` builtin command can be use to set options. There are two ways to set options  either by `set -o option-name` or, in short form, `set -option-abbrev` ****. To disable **an option, use `set +o option-name` ****or `set +option-abbrev` ****. To enable option on a script on the command line use, `set +o option-name script-name`  ****or ****`set option-abbrev script-name`

| Abbreviation | Name | Effect |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `-B` | brace expansion | Enable brace expansion (default setting = on) |
| `+B` | brace expansion | Disable brace expansion |
| `-C` | noclobber | Prevent overwriting of files by redirection (but this may  be overridden by `>\|` ) |
| `-D` | (none) | List double-quoted strings prefixed by $, but do not execute commands in script |
| `-a` | allexport | Export all defined variables |
| `-b` | notify | Notify when jobs running in background terminate (not of much use in a script) |
| `-c …` | (none) | Read commands from **...** |
| `checkjobs` |  | Informs user of any open jobs upon shell exit. Introduced in version 4 of Bash, and still "experimental." *Usage:* shopt -s checkjobs (*Caution:* may hang!) |
| `-e` | errexit | Abort script at first error, when a command exits with non-zero status (except in until or while loops, if-tests, list constructs) |
| `-f` | noglob | Disable filename expansion (globbing) |
| `globstar` | *globbing* star-match | Enables the `**` globbing operator. *Usage:* `shopt -s globstar` |
| `-i` | interactive | Runs a script in interactive mode |
| `-n` | noexec | Read commands in script, but do not execute them (syntax check) |
| `-o Option-Name` | (none) | Invoke the `Option-Name` option |
| `-o posix` | POSIX | Change the behavior of Bash, or invoked script, to conform to POSIX standard. |
| `-o pipefail` | pipe failure | Causes a pipeline to return the exit status of the last command in the pipe that returned a non-zero return value. |
| `-p` | privileged | Script runs as "suid" (caution!) |
| `-r` | restricted | Script runs in restricted mode |
| `-s` | stdin | Read commands from stdin |
| `-t` | onecmd | Exit after first command |
| `-u` | nounset | Attempt to use undefined variable outputs error message, and forces an exit |
| `-v` | verbose | Print each command to stdout before executing it |
| `-x` | xtrace | Similar to -v, but expands commands |
| `-` | (none) | End of options flag. All other arguments are positional parameters. |
| `--` | (none) | Unset positional parameters. If arguments given (*-- arg1 arg2*), positional parameters set to arguments. |

## Additional bash options

### Description

💡 The `shopt` builtin command allows you to change additional shell optional behavior.

### shopt options

| Option | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `-o` | Restrict the values of `<OPTNAME…>` to only those also known by the set builtin |
| `-p` | Print all shell options and their current value. **Default**. |
| `-q` | Quiet mode. Set exit code if named option is set. For multiple options: `TRUE` if all options are set, `FALSE` otherwise |
| `-s` | Enable (*s*et) the shell options named by `<OPTNAME…>` or list all *enabled* options if no names are given |
| `-u` | Disabe (*u*nset) the shell options named by `<OPTNAME…>` or list all *disabled* options  if no names are given |

### shopt syntax

🛠 `shopt [-pqsu] [-o] <OPTNAME...>`

💡 According to the option table, if only -s or -u are specified without any option names, only the currently enabled (-s) or disabled (-u) options are printed.

### **Exit code**

💡 When listing options, the exit code is `TRUE` (0), if all options are enabled, `FALSE` otherwise.

When setting/unsetting an option, the exit code is `TRUE` unless the named option doesn't exitst.

```bash
shopt -s nullglob  #Example to enable nullglob option
```

### **List of additional shell options**

| Option name | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `autocd`

I know using the cd command feels natural but that’s something I wanted to get to your attention. | If set, a command name that is the name of a directory is executed as if it were the argument to the cd command. |
| `cdspell` | If set, minor errors in the spelling of a directory component in a cd command will be corrected. The errors checked for are transposed characters, a missing character, and one character too many. If a correction is found, the corrected file name is printed, and the command proceeds. |
| `checkjobs` | If set, Bash lists the status of any stopped and running jobs before exiting an interactive shell. If any jobs are running, this causes the exit to be deferred until a second exit is attempted without an intervening command. The shell always postpones exiting if any jobs are stopped. |
| `dirspell` | If set, Bash will perform spelling corrections on directory names to match a glob. |
| `dotglob` | If set, Bash includes filenames beginning with a `.` (dot) in the results of [pathname expansion](https://wiki.bash-hackers.org/syntax/expansion/globs). |
| `nullglob` | If set, Bash allows filename patterns which match no files to expand to a null string, rather than themselves. |
| `failglob` | If set, patterns which fail to match filenames during filename expansion result in an expansion error. |
| `nocaseglob` | If set, Bash matches filenames in a case-insensitive fashion when performing filename expansion. |
| `globstar` | If set, the pattern ‘**’ used in a filename expansion context will match all files and zero or more directories and subdirectories. If the pattern is followed by a ‘/’, only directories and subdirectories match. |
